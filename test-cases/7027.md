## 01 VM single: deleting 1e6 unique time series with default settings

### Description

By default, VM single must allow to delete up to 1e6 unique time series.

### Test Steps

Start VM single with default value for `-search.maxDeleleSeries` flag:

```shell
rm -Rf ../data/*; make clean victoria-metrics; ./bin/victoria-metrics \
  -storageDataPath=../data/ \
  -search.maxSeries=1000000
```

NOTE: The `-search.maxSeries` was set to 1e6 in order to be able to query the
metrics (see below). Setting this flag is necessary because its default value is
30k.

Search the series to ensure that VM now has 0 unique time series:

```shell
curl http://localhost:8428/prometheus/api/v1/series -d 'match[]=metric_1'
```

Use `metricgen` to ingest exactly 1e6 unique time series:

```shell
go run ./cmd/insert \
  -writeURL=http://localhost:8428/api/v1/import/prometheus \
  -metricPattern='metric_1{id="%d",machine="%d",generation="%d"} %d' \
  -numMachines=1000 \
  -numMetrics=1000
```

Search the series with the query tracer enabled to ensure that VM now has 1e6
unique time series:

```shell
curl http://localhost:8428/prometheus/api/v1/series -d 'match[]=metric_1' \
  -d 'trace=1'
```

Try deleting them:

```shell
curl http://localhost:8428/api/v1/admin/tsdb/delete_series -d 'match[]=metric_1'
```

Search the series to ensure that VM now has 0 unique time series:

```shell
curl http://localhost:8428/prometheus/api/v1/series -d 'match[]=metric_1'
```

### Expected Result

The deletion must succeed and searching for series must return empty result.

### Actual Result

The deletion has succeed and searching for series has returned empty result.

### Cleanup

Stop victoria-metrics.

Delete data: `rm -Rf ../data/*`
