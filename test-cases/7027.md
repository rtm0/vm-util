## 01 VM single: deleting 1e6 unique time series with default settings

### Description

By default, VM single must allow to delete up to 1e6 unique time series.

### Test Steps

Start VM single with default value for `-search.maxDeleleSeries` flag:

```shell
rm -Rf ../data/*; make clean victoria-metrics; ./bin/victoria-metrics \
  -storageDataPath=../data/ \
  -search.maxSeries=1000000
```

NOTE: The `-search.maxSeries` was set to 1e6 in order to be able to query the
metrics (see below). Setting this flag is necessary because its default value is
30k.

Search the series to ensure that VM now has 0 unique time series:

```shell
curl http://localhost:8428/prometheus/api/v1/series -d 'match[]=metric_1'
```

Use `metricgen` to ingest exactly 1e6 unique time series:

```shell
go run ./cmd/insert \
  -writeURL=http://localhost:8428/api/v1/import/prometheus \
  -metricPattern='metric_1{id="%d",machine="%d",generation="%d"} %d' \
  -numMachines=1000 \
  -numMetrics=1000 \
  -once
```

Search the series with the query tracer enabled to ensure that VM now has 1e6
unique time series:

```shell
curl http://localhost:8428/prometheus/api/v1/series -d 'match[]=metric_1' \
  -d 'trace=1'
```

Try deleting them:

```shell
curl http://localhost:8428/api/v1/admin/tsdb/delete_series -d 'match[]=metric_1'
```

Search the series to ensure that VM now has 0 unique time series:

```shell
curl http://localhost:8428/prometheus/api/v1/series -d 'match[]=metric_1'
```

### Expected Result

The deletion must succeed and searching for series must return empty result.

### Actual Result

The deletion has succeed and searching for series has returned empty result.

### Cleanup

Stop victoria-metrics.

Delete data: `rm -Rf ../data/*`

## 02 VM single: deleting 1e6 + 1 unique time series with default settings

### Description

By default, VM single must allow to delete up to 1e6 unique time series.
However, it must fail if the number of time series to delete is 1e6 + 1.

### Test Steps

Start VM single with default value for `-search.maxDeleleSeries` flag:

```shell
rm -Rf ../data/*; make clean victoria-metrics; ./bin/victoria-metrics \
  -storageDataPath=../data/ \
  -search.maxSeries=1000001
```

Search the series to ensure that VM now has 0 unique time series:

```shell
curl http://localhost:8428/prometheus/api/v1/series -d 'match[]=metric_1'
```

Use `metricgen` to ingest exactly 1e6 unique time series:

```shell
go run ./cmd/insert \
  -writeURL=http://localhost:8428/api/v1/import/prometheus \
  -metricPattern='metric_1{id="%d",machine="%d",generation="%d"} %d' \
  -numMachines=1000 \
  -numMetrics=1000 \
  -once
```

Insert one more unique time series:

```shell
curl http://localhost:8428/api/v1/import/prometheus \
 -d 'metric_1{id="one more"} 123'
```

Search the series with the query tracer enabled to ensure that VM now has 1e6+1
unique time series:

```shell
curl http://localhost:8428/prometheus/api/v1/series -d 'match[]=metric_1' \
  -d 'trace=1'
```

Try deleting them:

```shell
curl http://localhost:8428/api/v1/admin/tsdb/delete_series -d 'match[]=metric_1'
```

Search the series to ensure that VM still has 1e6+1 unique time series:

```shell
curl http://localhost:8428/prometheus/api/v1/series -d 'match[]=metric_1' \
  -d 'trace=1'
```

### Expected Result

## 07 VM cluster: deleting 1e6 unique time series with custom vmstorage settings

### Description

Even though vmselect permits deleting up to 1 million series by default, this
value can be overriden at the vmstorage side and then the actual max number of
metrics to delete will be the smallest of the two settings. This test case checks
the behavior when the storage has the smaller number (1e6-1). So the deletion of
1e6 metrics must fail.

### Test Steps

Switch to `cluster` branch

```shell
git switch cluster
```

Build images:

```shell
make package
```

Find the image version:

```shell
docker images
```

Update `deployment/docker/docker-compose-cluster.yml` by changing the image
version for vmstorage, vminsert, and vmselect. Also set the vmselect
`-search.maxSeries` flag to 1000000. Also set the vminsert
`-replicationFactor=2` otherwise the records will be split evenly
across the vmstorage replicas. Finally, set the vmstorage
`-search.maxUniqueTimeseries` to 999999.

Start the VM cluster:

```shell
docker compose -f docker-compose-cluster.yml up -d
```

View its logs:

```shell
docker compose -f docker-compose-cluster.yml logs -f
```

Search the series to ensure that VM now has 0 unique time series:

```shell
curl http://localhost:8427/select/0/prometheus/api/v1/series -d 'match[]=metric_1'
```

Use `metricgen` to ingest exactly 1e6 unique time series:

```shell
go run ./cmd/insert \
  -writeURL=http://localhost:8429/api/v1/import/prometheus \
  -metricPattern='metric_1{id="%d",machine="%d",generation="%d"} %d' \
  -numMachines=1000 \
  -numMetrics=1000 \
  -once
```

Search the series with the query tracer enabled to ensure that VM now has 1e6
unique time series:

```shell
curl http://localhost:8427/select/0/prometheus/api/v1/series -d 'match[]=metric_1' \
  -d 'trace=1'
```

NOTE: The query should fail because vmstorate `-search.maxUniqueTimeseries` also
overrides the vmselect `-search.maxSeries`.

Try deleting them:

```shell
curl http://localhost:8427/delete/0/prometheus/api/v1/admin/tsdb/delete_series -d 'match[]=metric_1'
```

Search the series to ensure that VM now has 0 unique time series:

```shell
curl http://localhost:8427/select/0/prometheus/api/v1/series -d 'match[]=metric_1'
```

### Expected Result

The deletion must fail and searching must fail.

### Actual Result

The deletion fails and searching fails.

### Cleanup

Stop VM cluster and delete data:

```shell
docker compose -f docker-compose-cluster.yml down -v
```
