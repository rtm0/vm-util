# Test Cases for https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/6924

## 01 Slow replicas are ignored (no groups)

### Description

Confirm that vmselect does not wait for slow replicas. The replicas are
individual vmstorage instances not the groups vmstorage instances.

### Test Steps

Edit `deployment/docker/docker-compose-cluster.yml`:

-   Use `--replicationFactor=2` to instruct `vminsert` to replicate data across
    `vmstorage-1` and `vmstorage-2`.
-   Configure both `vmselects` with `--replicationFactor=2` and
    `-search.skipSlowReplicas=true`

Use `metricgen` to insert 1M unique time series:

```
go run ./cmd/insert \
   -writeURL=http://localhost:8429/api/v1/import/prometheus \
   -metricPattern='metric_1{id="%d",machine="%d",generation="%d"} %d' \
   -numMachines=1000 \
   -numMetrics=1000
   -once
```

Try querying the number of active time series, each vmstorage instance should
have at least 1M:

```
curl http://localhost:8427/select/0/prometheus/api/v1/query \
  -d 'query=vm_cache_entries{job="vmstorage", type="storage/hour_metric_ids"}' \
  -d 'trace=1' \
  | jq .
```

Try quierying the total number of data points by vmstorage instance, each should
have at least 1M:

```
curl http://localhost:8427/select/0/prometheus/api/v1/query \
  -d 'query=sum(vm_rows{job=~"vmstorage", type!~"indexdb/.*"}) by (instance)' \
  -d 'trace=1' \
  | jq .
```

Try getting the list of time series:

```shell
curl http://localhost:8427/select/0/prometheus/api/v1/series \
  -d 'match[]=vm_http_request_errors_total{job="vmstorage"}' \
  -d 'trace=1' \
  | jq .
```

Try querying the count of intested records:

```shell
curl http://localhost:8427/select/0/prometheus/api/v1/query \
  -d 'query=count(metric_1)' \
  -d 'trace=1' \
  | jq .
```


### Expected Result

The trace of each query from above should contain a meesage saying that a
request to one of the vmstorage instance has been cancelled because the other
replica has returned the request faster:

```
"message": "rpc at vmstorage vmstorage-2:8401: cancel request because
-search.skipSlowReplicas is set and every group returned the needed number of
responses according to replicationFactor",
```

### Actual Result

There is a message in the trace.

### Cleanup

Stop the docker compose:

```shell
docker compose -f docker-compose-cluster.yml down -v
```

## 02 Slow replicas are ignored (with groups)

### Description

Confirm that vmselect does not wait for slow replicas. The replicas are
the vmstorage instance groups.

### Test Steps

Edit `deployment/docker/docker-compose-cluster.yml`:

-   Use `--replicationFactor=2` to instruct `vminsert` to replicate data across
    `vmstorage-1` and `vmstorage-2`.
-   Configure both `vmselects` with the following flags:

	-   `--storageNode=gr1/vmstorage-1:8401`
	-   `--storageNode=gr2/vmstorage-2:8401`
    -   `--globalReplicationFactor=2`
    -   `--search.skipSlowReplicas=true`

Use `metricgen` to insert 1M unique time series:

```
go run ./cmd/insert \
   -writeURL=http://localhost:8429/api/v1/import/prometheus \
   -metricPattern='metric_1{id="%d",machine="%d",generation="%d"} %d' \
   -numMachines=1000 \
   -numMetrics=1000
   -once
```

Try querying the number of active time series, each vmstorage instance should
have at least 1M:

```
curl http://localhost:8427/select/0/prometheus/api/v1/query \
  -d 'query=vm_cache_entries{job="vmstorage", type="storage/hour_metric_ids"}' \
  -d 'trace=1' \
  | jq .
```

Try quierying the total number of data points by vmstorage instance, each should
have at least 1M:

```
curl http://localhost:8427/select/0/prometheus/api/v1/query \
  -d 'query=sum(vm_rows{job=~"vmstorage", type!~"indexdb/.*"}) by (instance)' \
  -d 'trace=1' \
  | jq .
```

Try getting the list of time series:

```shell
curl http://localhost:8427/select/0/prometheus/api/v1/series \
  -d 'match[]=vm_http_request_errors_total{job="vmstorage"}' \
  -d 'trace=1' \
  | jq .
```

```shell
curl http://localhost:8427/select/0/prometheus/api/v1/query \
  -d 'query=count(metric_1)' \
  -d 'trace=1' \
  | jq .

### Expected Result

The trace of each query from above should contain a meesage saying that a
request to one of the vmstorage instance has been cancelled because the other
replica has returned the request faster:

```
"message": "rpc at vmstorage vmstorage-2:8401: cancel request because
-search.skipSlowReplicas is set and every group returned the needed number of
responses according to replicationFactor",
```

### Actual Result

The message is not shown, i.e. a vmselect instance waits for responses from both
vmstorage instances.

### Cleanup

Stop the docker compose:

```shell
docker compose -f docker-compose-cluster.yml down -v
```
