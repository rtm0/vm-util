# Test Cases for https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/issues/7062

## 01 TestClientProxyReadOk run on laptop

### Description

Run TestClientProxyReadOk in an infinite loop on my laptop (12 cores, 16G of
memory). No heavy jobs should run at the same time.

### Test Steps

Ensure no resource demanding jobs are run on the laptop.

Run the test in an infinite loop until it fails:

```shell
../../../vm-util/scripts/test-until-fails.sh ./lib/promscrape -run TestClientProxyReadOk
```

### Expected Result

The test should never fail.

### Actual Result

The test hasn't failed after one day of running. After that the loop has been
terminated.

### Cleanup

Stop the loop.

## 02 TestClientProxyReadOk run on laptop under heavy load

### Description

Run TestClientProxyReadOk in an infinite loop on my laptop (12 cores, 16G of
memory). The laptop also runs some resource-demaing job (CPU utilization is
close to 100%).

### Test Steps

Start VM single:

```shell
rm -Rf ../data/*; make clean victoria-metrics; ./bin/victoria-metrics -storageDataPath=../data
```

Start loading some data into VM single:

```
go run ./cmd/insert -numMachines=1000 -numMetrics=2000 -churnRate=2000
```

This should put the CPU into near 100% CPU utilization state.

Run the test in an infinite loop until it fails:

```shell
time ../../../vm-util/scripts/test-until-fails.sh ./lib/promscrape -run TestClientProxyReadOk
```

### Expected Result

The test should never fail.

### Actual Result

The test fails after a minute or so:

```
2024/10/02 13:10:49 http: TLS handshake error from 127.0.0.1:46488: tls: first record does not look like a TLS handshake
2024/10/02 13:10:49 http: TLS handshake error from 127.0.0.1:46492: tls: first record does not look like a TLS handshake
--- FAIL: TestClientProxyReadOk (0.03s)

```

### Cleanup

Stop the loop, the metric generator, and the vm single.

Remove the data: `rm -Rf ../data/*`
